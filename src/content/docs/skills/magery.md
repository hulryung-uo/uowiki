*Kal Ort Por* — and you are somewhere else. Magery is the realm's most versatile skill: damage,
travel, defense, and utility across eight circles of spells.

**Stats:** Intelligence (primary), Strength (secondary) · **Title:** Mage

## How casting works

Each spell belongs to a **circle** (1–8). Per `MagerySpell.cs` (`GetCastSkills`), your chance
to successfully cast is a standard skill check across a window centered on
`(100/7) × (circle − 1)`, ±20 skill:

| Circle | Skill window (min–max) | 50% cast at | Mana |
|--------|------------------------|-------------|------|
| 1st | −20.0 – 20.0 | 0.0 | 4 |
| 2nd | −5.7 – 34.3 | 14.3 | 6 |
| 3rd | 8.6 – 48.6 | 28.6 | 9 |
| 4th | 22.9 – 62.9 | 42.9 | 11 |
| 5th | 37.1 – 77.1 | 57.1 | 14 |
| 6th | 51.4 – 91.4 | 71.4 | 20 |
| 7th | 65.7 – 105.7 | 85.7 | 40 |
| 8th | 80.0 – 120.0 | 100.0 | 50 |

Casting **from a scroll** counts as two circles lower (`circle -= 2` when `Scroll != null`),
so scrolls are both a convenience and a training tool. Cast delay grows with circle
(`(4 + circle)` ticks).

Every cast consumes [reagents](/items/reagents/); spell-by-spell recipes live in the
[Magic section](/magic/).

## Training

Cast spells whose window brackets your skill — too easy gains nothing, too hard can't be cast
(see [skill gain](/mechanics/skill-gain/)). A classic ladder:

- **0–30:** buy initial skill from an NPC mage; cast 1st–2nd circle (Magic Arrow, Cure).
- **30–55:** 3rd–4th circle — Fireball, Lightning, Recall (Recall everywhere; it's useful *and* trains).
- **55–75:** 5th–6th circle — Energy Bolt, Invisibility, Mark.
- **75–100:** 7th–8th circle — Flamestrike, Gate Travel, summons. The 8th circle reaches
  "no challenge" only at 120, so it trains to the cap.

Intelligence (primary stat) and Meditation determine how long you can keep casting; Eval Int
scales the damage. GGS guarantees the slow last points eventually arrive.
